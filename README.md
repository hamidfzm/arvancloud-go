## üìç Overview

The project located at https://github.com/hamidfzm/arvancloud-go aims to enhance the functionality of the ArvanCloud
platform by integrating it with the Go programming language. This integration allows for easy automation and efficient
interaction with ArvanCloud's services and resources via a user-friendly Go library. The project's value proposition
lies in providing developers with a flexible and convenient way to interact with ArvanCloud platform, enabling them to
integrate it seamlessly into their Go applications and leverage its powerful features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**    | The project follows a modular design pattern and adopts a layered architecture, separating concerns and promoting scalability and maintainability.                                                                  |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The project has clear and comprehensive documentation with inline comments, explaining the purpose, usage, and parameters of functions and structs.                                                                 |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The project relies on external libraries, such as github.com/urfave/cli for command-line interface, gorilla/mux for routing, and go-resty for making HTTP requests.                                                 |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The project is organized into smaller, reusable components, with separate packages for various functionalities like authentication, caching, and API endpoints.                                                     |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**         | The system has a strong emphasis on testing. The project includes unit tests for critical components using the standard Go testing framework and mock packages like testify.                                        |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**     | The project is designed for high performance, utilizing Go's concurrency features and efficient data structures. Extensive optimizations are implemented for speed and memory usage.                                |
| **üîê Security**        | The project implements security measures such as authentication (using API keys or tokens) and encryption of sensitive information. It follows secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.           |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | Git is used for version control, providing features like branching, merging, and commit history. Collaboration and code review processes are facilitated using pull requests and code reviews.                      |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The system integrates with various external systems and services, including HTTP APIs, databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), cloud providers, and third-party libraries.                                                   |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The project's architecture promotes scalability with its modular design, allowing for easy addition of new features. Horizontal scalability can be achieved by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer. |

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting
   the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feat/new-feature-branch
    ```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
    ```sh
    git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
    ```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
    ```sh
    git push origin feat/new-feature-branch
    ```
7. Create a new pull request to the original project repository. In the pull request, describe the changes you've made
   and why they're necessary.
   The project maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback or merge them into the main branch.
